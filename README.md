fCC Forum Leaderboard is a dynamic, responsive web application that showcases the latest topics from the freeCodeCamp forum. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project emphasizes a clean and minimalistic design inspired by Apple's elegant aesthetic.

The application retrieves real-time data from the freeCodeCamp forum, dynamically rendering topics with relevant information such as titles, categories, avatars of participants, reply counts, view counts, and the latest activity timestamps. Each topic title is clickable, seamlessly directing users to the corresponding discussion on the forum.

Key features include:

Responsive Design: Ensures a consistent user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
Elegant UI/UX: A sophisticated, minimalist layout with rounded corners, soft gradients, and refined typography enhances user engagement.
Smooth Animations: Subtle hover effects and interactive elements provide a modern, polished feel.

This project demonstrates proficiency in front-end development, showcasing skills in responsive design, dynamic data handling, and modern UI/UX practices. It reflects a keen eye for aesthetics while maintaining functionality and performance, making it a valuable addition to my portfolio.
